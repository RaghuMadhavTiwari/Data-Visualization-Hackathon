# Data-Visulization-Hackathom-
### Tableau Viz as a part of Machine Hack Hackathon

We often order food from food delivery apps like Zomato, Swiggy. Sometimes it often takes time to deliver the food. There are factors which impact the delivery time of the food.

In this hackathon we are going to work on a data visualization challenge to analyse and visualize the food delivery time from the same location but different cuisines and rating of the restaurants.

Data: 
11095 rows x 9 columns

Restaurants (unique ID of restaurants)
